# 🎯 Bayesian Truncation: When Data Cannot Overcome Prior Belief (R Analysis)

## 💡 Compact Description

Investigating **Bayesian Truncation**: R simulation and analysis demonstrating how a highly informative, **truncated prior** (defined on $\theta \in [0, 0.5]$) forces the **posterior distribution** to zero, even when the simulated data (with a true $\theta=0.7$) strongly favors a value outside the prior's boundary. A classic example of **prior dominance** over the likelihood.

## 📈 The Conflict: Prior vs. Likelihood

This project visualizes a fundamental principle of Bayesian inference where a strong prior belief (even if incorrect) restricts the final outcome.

1.  **The Prior (Belief):** The triangular prior is defined only on $\theta \in [0, 0.5]$. Outside this boundary, its density is **zero**.

    *You should save an image visualizing just the triangular prior as `prior.png` in your repository.*

2.  **The Data (Evidence):** Data are simulated from a true $\theta=0.7$. This results in a **Maximum Likelihood Estimate ($\text{MLE}$) far above $0.5$**.

The resulting **Posterior Distribution** is calculated as $\text{Prior} \times \text{Likelihood}$. Since multiplying by zero always yields zero, the posterior is **truncated** at $\theta=0.5$.

## ⚙️ Mathematical and Computational Notes

* **Prior Function:**
    $$
    \text{Prior}(\theta) = \begin{cases} 8\theta & \text{for } 0 \le \theta \le 0.5 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
    $$
* **Normalization:** The $\text{R}$ script uses a **grid approximation** for numerical stability. The normalization step (`post_vals / sum(post_vals)`) ensures the sum of the discrete probability masses is 1, a standard technique for continuous distributions evaluated on a discrete grid.

## 💾 Project Files

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `bayesian_prior_analysis.R` | The full R script to simulate data, calculate, and plot the prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions. |
| `result.png` | **Required:** The main output plot (the one with the blue, dashed black, and dashed red lines) generated by the R script. |
| `prior.png` | **Required:** A separate plot or visualization of the Triangular Prior alone. |

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

1.  Save the R code as `bayesian_prior_analysis.R`.
2.  Ensure you have an $\text{R}$ environment set up.
3.  Execute the script:
    ```r
    source("bayesian_prior_analysis.R")
    ```
