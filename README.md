# Bayesian-Truncation-When-Data-Cannot-Overcome-Prior-Belief
Investigating Bayesian Truncation: R simulation and analysis demonstrating how a highly informative, truncated prior (defined on $\theta \in [0, 0.5]$) forces the posterior distribution to zero, even when the simulated data (with a true $\theta=0.7$) strongly favors a value outside the prior's boundary.
